A simple Mandlebrot fractal generating program.<br><br>
This uses the pseudo code from the wikipedia entry and so doesn't use complex numbers.<br><br>
The code hasn't been optimized or really thought about.<br><br>
Program takes about 6-7 seconds to calculate on a M1 in debug mode.<br><br>
Uses a very naive colour calculator.
