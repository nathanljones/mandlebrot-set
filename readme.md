# A simple Mandlebrot fractal generating program.<br><br>
This uses the pseudo code from the wikipedia entry and so doesn't use complex numbers.<br><br>
The code uses rayon to speed up the pixel calculations.<br><br>
Program takes about 2 seconds to calculate on a M1 in debug mode.<br><br>
Uses a very naive colour calculator.
